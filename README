This project is an intent of combining two great technologies: 

 * Node.JS and Rails framework.

We're just in the planning phase of the project.

The next steps are:

 * Create a simple CRUD example using just Node.JS and its extensions. This example should exhibit:
  - One domain class;
  - One controller;
  - One view;
 * Code the persistence layer, which automatically stores and retrieves domain classes;
 * Code the controller logic in a Rails fashion;
 * Code the view (decide which templating technology to use: jade, haml, ...).

That's engough for now.
